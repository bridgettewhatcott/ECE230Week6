## Lab Questions

### 1 - Explain the differences between our Half Adder from last lab and the Half Subtractor from this lab.
A Half Subtractor deals with adding a negative number, while a Half Adder just adds normally. The Half Subtractor behaves like a Half Adder, with
a negative.
### 2 - What about the end around carry of One’s Complement makes it hard to use and implement?
We had to connect each individual wire for the One's Complement to each adders, which made a long file that will run significantly slower on the computer.
### 3 - What is the edge case and problem with Two’s Complement number representation?
If the carry out ends up as a 1 on the left side of the MSB, it has no place to go and therefore produces an inaccurate result.
